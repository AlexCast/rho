\title{Density of water}
\usage{
d_water(Tc = 20, S = 0, P = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{Tc}{Temperature (ÂºC).}

\item{S}{Salinity (parts per thousand).}

\item{P}{Pressure (bar in excess of 1 ATM).}
}
\description{
This function calculates the water density as a function of pressure, 
temprature and salinity.
}
\details{
The density of pure (saline) water at diferent pressures is based on 
the UNESCO (1981) report, as recomended by Zhang et al. (2009) and Libes 
(2009). The UNESCO equation has a relative error of 0.0004% (Zhang et al.,
2009). The actual function was implemented with corrections by from 
Forfonoff (1985), as recomended by Libes (2009).
