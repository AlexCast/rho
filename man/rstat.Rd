\title{Calculate retrieval statistics}
\usage{
rstat(x, y, log = FALSE, ux = FALSE, units = "")

lstat(stats, digits = 3)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Reference data.}

\item{y}{Estimated data.}

\item{log}{Logical. Should log based performance statistics be computed?}

\item{ux}{Logical. Calculate unbiased differences?}

\item{units}{Units of the data.}

\item{stats}{object created by \code{rstat}.}

\item{digits}{number of digits to be passed to \code{round}.}
}
\value{
A named list with component statistics and units for \code{rstat} and 
a vector of expressions for plot legend.
}
\description{
The function calculates useful descriptive statistics to evaluate the 
estimation and create a vector of strings for plotting.
}
\details{
Those functions are wrappers for descriptive statistics and 
convenient text strings for addition to a plot. They provide the statistics 
of the agreement of the estimated data against the reference data; i.e.
evaluates estimations against the 1:1 relation. Statistics include the mean 
absolute percentage difference (MAPD), the mean percentage error (bias), the 
root mean squared difference (RMSD), the coefficient of determination (R^2), 
the number of data points, and the range of the reference data.

The parameter 'units' is also available for convenience of use with the
\code{lstats} function, to add those statistics to a plot. It should be a 
character string that can be used in expressions. See examples.

When x does not present smaller uncertainty than y, ux can be set to TRUE to 
calculate unbiased statistics in linear space. In that case, the normalization 
of MAPD and bias is not on x by on the average of x and y. This approach 
might also be used if some values are very close to zero.

For heterocedastic data or data spanning multiple orders of magnitude, log 
can be set to TRUE to calculate performance statistics in log space. Note 
in this case the units are set to '' (unitless). The MAPD and bias are 
retrieved in % with:

MAPD = 100 * (10^((1 / n) * sum(|log10(x) - log10(y)|)) - 1)
Bias = 100 * (10^((1 / n) * sum(log10(x) - log10(y))) - 1)
}
\examples{
x <- 1:10
y <- x + rnorm(10)
(rs <- rstat(x, y, units = bquote(m^-1)))
plot(x, y)
legend("bottomright", lstat(rs), bty = "n")
